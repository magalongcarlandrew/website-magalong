        <h2><b>Childhood</b></h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>I am Carl Andrew Magalong, known in our area as “Andoy.”<sup>2</sup> My childhood was filled with joy, laughter, and unforgettable memories with my family and friends.<sup>3</sup> Every afternoon, we would play outside until it got dark.<sup>4</sup> We enjoyed street games like dampa, tumbang preso, teks, pogs, and jolens.<sup>5</sup> These games were a huge part of my childhood, and they created strong bonds between me and my friends.<sup>6</sup> I also loved going to the computer shops, where I spent hours playing video games with my buddies.<sup>7</sup> Although I was mischievous and stubborn back then, it never stopped me from having fun.<sup>8</sup> I was the type to ask a lot of questions, always curious about the world around me.<sup>9</sup> I remember catching ants and putting them in a glass with soil to observe them.<sup>10</sup> I was also fond of basketball and played near our house whenever I had the chance.<sup>11</sup> There’s this one memory of crossing the street for the first time, not looking to the left or right, and almost getting hit by a car.<sup>12</sup> Fortunately, nothing serious happened, and I learned to be more cautious afterward.<sup>13</sup> Fridays were always special because my grandma would take me to Jollibee.<sup>14</sup> That’s when I developed a love for Coke Float, which became my go-to treat.<sup>15</sup> I also loved climbing the guava tree in our yard to pick ripe fruits and play hide-and-seek with my friends.<sup>16</sup> During the rainy season, I had the best time soaking in the rain and splashing around in the floodwater with my neighborhood pals.<sup>17</sup> Every year, I eagerly awaited the fiesta because it meant the carnival would come to town.<sup>18</sup> I loved playing games there, trying my luck at winning prizes.<sup>19</sup> As a kid, I was a big fan of anime, especially Dragon Ball and Naruto.<sup>20</sup> I remember watching them after school and eagerly discussing the episodes with my friends.<sup>21</sup> I also enjoyed playing with the new toys that my friends would get.<sup>22</sup> Sometimes, I would insist on riding my bike even though I wasn’t good at it yet, and my parents would scold me.<sup>23</sup> I also accompanied my grandma to the market, and I always looked forward to getting candy from her.<sup>24</sup> One of my most unforgettable memories was when I learned to swim in the river with my cousins.<sup>25</sup> Even though I was scared of the loud fireworks during New Year’s, I couldn’t help but feel excited to watch the colorful displays in the sky.</p>

        <!--Teenage Paragraph-->
        <h2><b>Teenage</b></h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>When I turned 13, I started studying at a public school.<sup>2</sup> My first year was uneventful, but things started to change in my second year.<sup>3</sup> I learned how to cut classes and hang out with my friends outside of school.<sup>4</sup> This marked the beginning of my teenage rebellion.<sup>5</sup> It was also during this time that I drank alcohol for the first time.<sup>6</sup> From that point on, I began spending more time out at night, away from home.<sup>7</sup> Hanging out with my friends became a regular part of my life, but it also meant I was often coming home late and getting scolded by my parents.<sup>8</sup> Smoking became part of my routine as well, which wasn’t a good habit to pick up.<sup>9</sup> I was also involved in the usual teenage mischief at school, like teasing the teachers and pulling pranks on my classmates.<sup>10</sup> Despite all of that, I still tried to keep up with my studies so my parents wouldn’t get too upset with me.<sup>11</sup> I was happy during this time because I had a solid group of friends who I spent a lot of time with.<sup>12</sup> After school, we would hang out together, playing games or just chatting.<sup>13</sup> Whenever I had extra money, I would go to the computer shop and play online games for hours.<sup>14</sup> It was also during this time that I learned how to manage my money, especially when my allowance ran out too quickly.<sup>15</sup> I started taking risks in life, which helped me grow as a person.<sup>16</sup> It was also during my teenage years that I experienced my first crush and fell in love.<sup>17</sup> I didn’t know how to handle my feelings at first, but it taught me valuable lessons about relationships.<sup>18</sup> Along with the excitement of new experiences came the challenges, including arguments with my parents about my frequent outings.<sup>19</sup> However, I also learned how to ask for forgiveness when I made mistakes.<sup>20</sup> I became determined to change and to work toward fulfilling the dreams I once had.<sup>21</sup> The lessons I learned during this period helped shape the person I was becoming.<sup>22</sup> Despite the challenges, I was grateful for the experiences that taught me how to navigate life’s ups and downs.</p>

        <!--College Paragraph-->
        <h2><b>College</b></h2>
       <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>When I moved to Manila for college, I wasn’t sure if it was the right place for me.<sup>2</sup> At first, I was confused about which school to attend, and I wasn’t entirely sure about my future.<sup>3</sup> I remember feeling homesick and overwhelmed by the unfamiliarity of the city.<sup>4</sup> Coming from a small town, the fast-paced life in Manila was a huge adjustment for me.<sup>5</sup> I had trouble sleeping and adjusting to the new environment, but my sister, who was with me during my first year, provided me with guidance and support.<sup>6</sup> She helped me navigate through the challenges of college life, making it easier for me to settle in.<sup>7</sup> However, when I reached my second year, my sister wasn’t around anymore, and I had to figure things out on my own.<sup>8</sup> It was a difficult transition because, for the first time, I was living independently and doing everything on my own.<sup>9</sup> After 19 years of living with my family, this new chapter felt both exciting and daunting.<sup>10</sup> I had to cook my own meals, manage my finances, and deal with the stresses of school by myself.<sup>11</sup> Despite the initial difficulties, I began to adjust to my new life, making new friends along the way.<sup>12</sup> College life taught me a lot about responsibility and self-sufficiency.<sup>13</sup> I also realized that there was so much more to life beyond the familiar world I had known back home.<sup>14</sup> During my time in Manila, I had the opportunity to visit different places, which broadened my perspective on life.<sup>15</sup> I began to dream bigger and think about all the possibilities that lay ahead of me.<sup>16</sup> Now, in my second year and second semester, I feel more confident and capable of handling the challenges that come my way.<sup>17</sup> I remember the anxiety I felt when I first started, wondering if I would fail and disappoint my parents.<sup>18</sup> I didn’t want to become irregular and face the possibility of being sent back home.<sup>19</sup> That fear motivated me to always do my best and push through even when things seemed tough.<sup>20</sup> With every passing day, I grew stronger, learning new things from my professors and peers.<sup>21</sup> Although the road to graduation still feels far, I’m determined to finish my studies on time and with fewer problems along the way.<sup>22</sup> Looking back, I’m proud of how far I’ve come and grateful for the lessons I’ve learned.<sup>23</sup> I know that there will be more challenges ahead, but I’m ready to face them head-on.</p>
